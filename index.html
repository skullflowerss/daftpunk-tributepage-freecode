                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1987</strong> - <i>Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo</i> and <i>Thomas Bangalter</i> met in 1987 while attending the Lyc√©e Carnot secondary school in Paris. The two became friends and recorded demos with others from the school. This led to the formation of a guitar-based group called Darlin' with Laurent Brancowitz in 1992.  </li>
                        <li><strong>1992</strong> - A negative review in Melody Maker by <i>Dave Jennings</i> subsequently dubbed the music "a daft punky thrash." Instead of dismissing the review, they found it amusing. As Homem-Christo stated, "We struggled so long to find [the name] Darlin', and this happened so quickly." Darlin' soon disbanded, leaving <i>Brancowitz</i> to pursue other efforts with Phoenix. <i>Bangalter</i> and <i>Homem-Christo</i> formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesisers. </li>
                        <li><strong>1993</strong> - In September 1993, Daft Punk attended a rave at EuroDisney, where they met <i></i>Stuart Macmillan of Slam, co-founder of the label Soma Quality Recordings.</li>
                        <li><strong>1995</strong> - Daft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record "Da Funk". It became the duo's first commercially successful single the same year. </li>
                        <li><strong>1996</strong> - In the mid-to-late nineties, Daft Punk performed live without costumes in many places including the United States. In 1996, the duo were featured at an Even Furthur event in Wisconsin, their first public performance in the U.S. In addition to live original performances, they performed in various clubs using vinyl records from their collection. They were known for incorporating various styles of music into their DJ sets at that time.</li>
                        <li><strong>1999</strong> - By 1999, the duo was well into the recording sessions for its second album, which had begun a year earlier. The 2001 release of Discovery took on a slicker and distinctly synthpop-oriented style, initially stunning fans of Daft Punk's previous material in Homework. The group states that the album was conceived as an attempt to reconnect with a playful, open-minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood.</li>
                        <li><strong>2003</strong> - The year 2003 saw the release of the feature-length animated film, Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. Daft Punk produced the film under the supervision of <i>Leiji Matsumoto</i>, who is their childhood hero.</li>
                        <li><strong>2005</strong> - In March 2005, Daft Punk released their third album, Human After All, the result of six weeks of writing and recording.</li>
                        <li><strong>2006 - 2007</strong> - The Alive 2006/2007 tour began with a sole United States performance at the Coachella Festival in Indio, California in April 2006. Several festival appearances in Europe followed throughout the summer. Two consecutive performances also took place at the Summer Sonic Festival in Japan, held in Osaka and Chiba City respectively. Daft Punk's final performance of the year occurred in the autumn, when they visited South America and played their second U.S. performance at the Bang! Music Festival in Miami, Florida.</li>
                        <li><strong>2007</strong> - Daft Punk released its second live album titled Alive 2007 on 19 November 2007. It contains the duo's performance in Paris from the Alive 2007 tour. The live version of "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" from Alive 2007 was released as a single. <i>Olivier Gondry</i> directed a music video for the single that features footage shot by 250 audience members at Daft Punk's Brooklyn appearance at KeySpan Park, Coney Island.</li>
